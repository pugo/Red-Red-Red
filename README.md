# Red-red-red

Chrome used to have quite nice colored themes up to some year ago. Then they
changed their UI to some very dull and boring accent colors. I can not live like
that. **I need colors!**

This is a Chrome theme exactly as I want it. It is red. And more red.
Most importantly it distinguishes tabs and other parts in a good visible way.
